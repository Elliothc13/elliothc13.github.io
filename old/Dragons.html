<b><u><h1>Dragons - Fire Breathing Giants</h1></u></b>
<h2> Dragon </h2>
<img src="images/dragon1.png" >

<p> A dragon is a large, serpent-like legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures around the world.
Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire.
Dragons are Terrifying creatures. Some small. Most on the larger side. They tormented people back in the middle ages while still staying illusive.
Many tales have been created about Dragons as nobody has properly seen one and lived to tell the tale.
