  <p> 
  The unicorn is a legendary creature that is a beast witha single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead.
  The horn itself and the substance it was made of was called alicorn, and it was believed that the horn holds magical and medicinal properties.
  False alicorn powder, made from the tusks of narwhals or horns of various animals, has been sold in Europe for medicinal purposes as late as 1741.
