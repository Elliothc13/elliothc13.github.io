  <p> Fairies are generally described as human in appearance and having magical powers. Diminutive fairies of various kinds have been reported through centuries, ranging from quite tiny to the size of a human child. These small sizes could be magically assumed, rather than constant. Some smaller fairies could expand their figures to imitate humans. Fairies were described as short in stature, dressed in dark grey,green or blue sometimes seen in armour. Fairies have green eyes. Some depictions of fairies show them with footwear, others as barefoot. Wings, while common in Victorian and later artworks, are rare fairies flew by means of magic, sometimes perched on ragwort stems or the backs of birds. </p>
